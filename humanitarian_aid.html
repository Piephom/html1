        <h3>UN World Food Program</h3>
        <p>Conflict is the main driver of hunger and food insecurity in the world. WFP is on the ground inside Ukraine and neighboring countries to provide critical food assistance to those affected by this devastating war. In one month, WFP provided ready-to-eat food, bread and cash assistance to 1 million people affected by the war. We aim to reach 6M people inside Ukraine and 300,000 Ukrainians in neighboring countries.</p>

        <h3>MSF/ Doctors Without Borders</h3>
        <p>MSF has a longstanding presence in Ukraine, including in parts of the eastern region that have been affected by armed conflict since 2014. A large part of our work in Ukraine from 2014 to 2021 was responding to the needs of patients with HIV, tuberculosis, or other chronic illnesses. Due to the current war, we have halted normal activities and have started emergency activities in Ukraine. We currently have teams in Kyiv, Lviv, Vinnytsia, Zhytomir, Dnipro, Kharkiv, Odessa, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Bila Tserkva, Uzhhorod and Ivano-Frankivsk. We also have teams in Poland, Moldova, Hungary, Slovakia, Russia, and Belarus. MSF is an independent and impartial organization committed to providing medical humanitarian assistance to people affected by the war no matter who they are or where they are.
        <br>
        <br>MSF staff in Ukraine are delivering urgent medical supplies, training health workers on managing mass casualty incidents, running mobile clinics, and organizing medical evacuations of hospitalized patients from the east to the west of the country.</p>

        <h2>Human Trafficking</h2>

        <h3>UNICEF</h3>
        <p>The past eight years of conflict in Ukraine have already inflicted profound and lasting harm on children. Now, the threats to Ukraine’s children have only grown. By 8 May, more than 5.8 million refugees had fled Ukraine, around half of them children. Millions more people have been internally displaced. Such large-scale displacements could have lasting consequences for generations to come. Children fleeing war in Ukraine are also at heightened risk of human trafficking and exploitation. Meanwhile, attacks using explosive weapons in populated urban areas continue to inflict civilian casualties including among children, and considerable damage to essential infrastructure and services. As a result, children’s homes, schools, hospitals, water systems, power plants, and places where civilians are seeking shelter have been damaged or destroyed.</p>

        <h3>Hope For Justice</h3>
        <p>More than 70 of the world’s leading anti-trafficking organizations have come together to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the impact it is having on the risk of human trafficking in the region.</p>
