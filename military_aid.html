        <h3>Spirit Of America</h3>
        <p>Spirit of America is working closely with US military and State Department personnel to meet the urgent needs of Ukrainian forces. Save lives by providing body armor, first aid kits, food supplies, and more to Ukrainian soldiers and civillian volunteers on the front lines.</p>
        <br>
        <p>“Ukraine’s courageous and brave civilian military is fighting for their country’s very existence, often without the equipment and supplies they need. Spirit of America – funded through the incredible generosity of our donors, large and small – is helping the citizen-soldiers of the Territory Defense Forces swap their skateboard pads and bike helmets for bulletproof vests and ballistic helmets. It is an honor to be working so closely with our partners and to play a part in defending freedom and democracy.” – Jim Hake, Spirit of America CEO</p>

        <p>The Alliance for Ukraine is rapidly procuring medical supplies in the US that have already been depleted in Europe. Experienced members of our network are personally delivering them to Poland, from where they will be sent to Ukraine.</p>

        <h3>Razom</h3>
        <p>Razom’s Emergency Response is the SOS button that is pressed in times of need. We created this project to provide urgent help and support in face of an extreme and unforeseen situation in Ukraine. Today, the sovereign nation of Ukraine has to deal with the most horrendous and catastrophic emergency – a brutal invasion. Razom is responding to this by providing critical medical supplies and amplifying the voices of Ukrainians.</p>

        <h3>National Bank of Ukraine</h3>
        <p>Due to international trade laws, it is currently not legal to send weapons, nightvision devices, pertinent weapons optics, or ammution overseas to Ukraine without a Department of Defense export license (ITAR license). The National Bank of Ukraine is a loophole for that, funding the Ukranian military first hand.</p>
